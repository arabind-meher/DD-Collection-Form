        <div class="content">
            <p>
                A demand draft is a negotiable instrument similar to a bill of exchange. A bank issues a demand draft to
                a client (drawer), directing another bank (drawee) or one of its own branches to pay a certain sum to
                the specified party (payee). A demand draft can also be compared to a cheque. However, demand drafts are
                difficult to countermand. Demand drafts can only be made payable to a specified party, also known as pay
                to order. But, cheques can also be made payable to the bearer. Demand drafts are orders of payment by a
                bank to another bank, whereas cheques are orders of payment from an account holder to the bank.

            <p>
                Demand drafts are also known as sight drafts, as they are payable when presented by sight to the bank.
                Under UCC 3-104, a draft has been defined as a negotiable instrument in the form of an order. The person
                making the order is known as the drawer and the person specified in the order is called the drawee, as
                defined in the UCC 3-103. The party who creates the draft is called the maker, and the party who is
                ordered to pay is called the drawee. In US, remotely created cheques are also called demand drafts.
                Remotely created cheques are orders of payment created by the payee and authorized by the customer
                remotely, using a telephone or the internet by providing the required information including the MICR
                code from a valid cheque. They do not bear the signatures of the customers like ordinary cheques.
                Instead, they bear a legend statement "Authorized by Drawer". This type of instrument is usually used by
                credit card companies, utility companies, or telemarketers. Remotely created cheques are susceptible to
                fraud.

        <button class="collapsible">Understanding Demand Drafts</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                When a bank prepares a demand draft, the amount of the draft is taken from the account of the customer
                requesting the draft and is transferred to an account at another bank. The drawer is the person
                requesting the demand draft; the bank paying the money is the drawee; the party receiving the money is
                the payee. Demand drafts were originally designed to benefit legitimate telemarketers who needed to
                withdraw funds from customer checking accounts using their bank account numbers and bank routing
                numbers. For example, if a small business owner purchases products from another company on credit, the
                small business owner asks his bank to send a demand draft to the company for payment of the products,
                making him the drawer. The bank issues the draft, making it the drawee. After the draft matures, the
                owner of the other company brings the demand draft to his bank and collects his payment, making him the
                payee.

        <button class="collapsible">Why are Demand Drafts popular?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Demand drafts are popular because they can only be paid to the drawee. In addition to this, the fact
                that the instrument can be prepared from any bank irrespective of having a bank account with them comes
                in handy. While the instrument is prepared normally in Indian currency, the draft can be prepared in
                foreign currency as well. As there is no risk of non-clearance of a demand draft, it is a preferable
                option of sending payments abroad.

        <button class="collapsible">Demand Drafts Versus Checks</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                A demand draft is issued by a bank while a check is issued by an individual. Also, a demand draft is
                drawn by an employee of a bank while a check is drawn by a customer of a bank. Payment of a demand draft
                may not be stopped by the drawer as it may with a check. Although a check can be hand-delivered, this is
                not the case with a demand draft. The draft may be drawn regardless of whether an individual holds an
                account at the bank while a check may be written only by an account holder.
