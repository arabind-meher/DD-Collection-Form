        <button class="collapsible">Features of a Demand Draft</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                There are a number of features of a demand draft such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can only be paid on demand.</li>
                <li>
                    Under the act of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, in section 85, complete information has been laid
                    out about demand drafts.
                </li>
                <li>It shouldn’t be paid to the bearer</li>
                <li>
                    There is a specific amount of charge attached to the demand draft. RBI decides services charges for
                    demand drafts but each and every bank is free to have their own service charges.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example- State Bank of India (SBI) service charges are Rs. 5 per Rs. 1000 for above Rs. 10,000 to
                Rs. 1,00,000.

        <button class="collapsible">Cancelling the Demand Draft</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                You can cancel your demand draft through the following steps: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are no online services provided by the bank for the cancellation of your demand draft. If you
                    want to cancel your demand draft in any case and want your deducted money back then you will have to
                    visit the bank personally.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are two cases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Demand Draft Issued through Cash</b>: In this case you need to submit your demand draft along
                    with the cash receipt. The cash will be refunded immediately but there is a chance of deduction of
                    some amount which varies from bank to bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Demand Draft Issued through Cheque</b>: In this case, you just need to submit the cancellation
                    form along with the original demand draft. The amount will be refunded but there may be some
                    cancellation charges.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There may be a case where you don’t have your original demand draft. Cancelling your demand draft in
                this case will be quite tough. If you want to cancel your demand draft then the bank will make you sign
                an indemnity bond. Your demand draft will be cancelled during the period of one week but some banks may
                take more time.
